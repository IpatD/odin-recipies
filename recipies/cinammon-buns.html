        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
            <p>These are classic, homestyle cinnamon rolls.<br> 
            It took me lots of recipe testing trial-and-error to develop quick <br>
            cinnamon rolls that maintain all the flavor and texture of traditional<br>
            overnight cinnamon rolls. <strong>But THIS. IS. IT.</strong> <br>
            And I promise, making these easy cinnamon rolls is 100x more satisfying<br>
            than that feeling you get from popping open a store-bought<br>
            can of ready-to-bake rolls.

        <h2><strong>Ingridients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong>flour provides the dough structure. All-purpose flour is best for these cinnamon rolls.<br>
                You could also use bread flour the rolls will be chewier</li>
            <li><Strong>Sugar:</Strong> You need white granulated sugar in the dough, both for flavor and to feed the yeast.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Flavor</li>
            <li><strong>Whole milk:</strong> hole milk is ideal for the richest-tasting cinnamon rolls. Buttermilk works <br>
                just as well without any changes to the recipe. Many readers have successfully substituted nondairy milks. 
                <br>In a pinch, you can use low-fat milk, but avoid using nonfat milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong> This is a rich dough, meaning it has fat to help guarantee softness.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg: </strong>Like butter, egg promises a softer, richer dough.</li>
        </ul>
